# TypeScript Solutions Repository

This repository contains solutions to various problems using TypeScript, focusing on core features like classes, functions, unions, and generators. All problems are solved within the `src` folder, where each solution demonstrates key concepts and best practices in TypeScript.

## Features

- **TypeScript Classes**: Practical examples of creating and using classes, encapsulating logic and behaviors.
- **Functions**: Solutions that utilize TypeScript functions, with clear input/output types.
- **Union Types**: Examples of using union types to handle multiple possible data types in a clean and type-safe way.
- **Generators**: Usage of TypeScript generators to produce values lazily and efficiently.

## Folder Structure

```
src/
├── problem-1.ts
├── problem-2.ts
├── problem-3.ts
├── problem-4.ts
├── problem-5.ts
├── problem-6.ts
├── problem-7.ts
├── problem-8.ts
└── ...
```

Each file in the `src` folder solves a specific TypeScript problem, demonstrating a different concept or feature.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the solutions with the following command, changing the number based on the problem you want to run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev --src/problem-1.ts
   npm run dev --src/problem-2.ts
   npm run dev --src/problem-3.ts
   ```

   This command uses `ts-node-dev` to run the TypeScript files and will automatically reload for any changes. Replace `problem-1.ts` with the appropriate file for the problem you'd like to run.
