Sure! Here's a revised version that includes type definitions before the code examples:

**Understanding async/await in TypeScript**

In TypeScript, `async/await` makes asynchronous code look like regular, synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain. An `async` function always returns a Promise, and `await` can only be used inside an `async` function.

**Defining Types**

Before jumping into the examples, let’s define some types to make our code more clear and type-safe:

```typescript
interface Employee {
    id: number;
    employee_name: string;
    employee_salary: number;
    employee_age: number;
    profile_image: string;
}

type ApiResponse = Record<string, number | string>;
```

**Using async/await**

With the types in place, here’s how we can use `async/await` to handle asynchronous operations:

```typescript
const myAsync = async (): Promise<ApiResponse> => {
    await angelMowersPromise;
    const response = await myPaymentPromise;
    return response;
}
```

In this example, `myAsync` is an `async` function that waits for `angelMowersPromise` and `myPaymentPromise` to resolve before returning the response.

**Error Handling with try/catch**

You can handle errors in an `async` function with a `try/catch` block. If something goes wrong, the `catch` block will handle the error:

```typescript
const fetchEmployees = async (): Promise<Employee[] | string> => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(api);
        const { data } = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        return error.message;
    }
}
```

In this example, `fetchEmployees` fetches employee data from an API. If there’s an error (e.g., the network fails), it returns the error message.

**Key Takeaways**

- `async/await` makes working with asynchronous code simpler and cleaner.
- Always use `try/catch` to handle errors in async functions.

This way, your asynchronous code will be more readable and manageable!
